title: Road-trip Map-Blog
---

I created a map-based road-trip blog to share progress of my journey with friends and family. I used Jekyll, Mapbox GL JS, and CARTO VL with Formspree and TinyLetter incorporated to help viewers subscribe and send us suggestions. I also added Google Analytics to track how many people were visiting and viewing our posts.
