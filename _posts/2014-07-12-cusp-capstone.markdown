title: CUSP Capstone
project-date: July 2017
---
For my final capstone project at CUSP, I teamed up with four classmates to work with researchers from [BetaGov](http://www.betagov.org/) and the [Santa Clara District Attorney](https://www.sccgov.org/sites/da/Pages/DA-office-site-home-page.aspx) to analyze case timeline data and determine what caused delays in the prosecutorial process.

For my role in the project, I contributed in the data cleaning, data exploration, and random forest modeling for predicting time to case resolution. I also coordinated communication between the CUSP team, BetaGov and Santa Clara. We traveled to Santa Clara to present our initial findings and receive feedback on our work.
